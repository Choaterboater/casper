/**
 * Safety labels for MCP tools.
 *
 * Rule: a label can only get stricter than what the server says, and never looser than the label
 * Casper 0.2.14 gave the same tool (`legacyLabel`, kept word for word below). Nothing here can make a
 * tool read-only: only the server's own readOnlyHint can, and only when the name agrees. Words in a
 * tool name, `_meta["casper/safety"]` and presets may add approvals; they never remove one.
 *
 * Word lists: the network words (bounce, reload, halt, deauth, zeroize, ...) are Casper's own. The
 * general delete / change / run / read families were checked against, and partly taken from, the
 * actlint vocabulary (package actlint 0.3.0, vocabulary 0.5.0, by Formael, Apache-2.0,
 * https://github.com/formael/actlint). actlint ships no NOTICE file; its credit is in
 * THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt.
